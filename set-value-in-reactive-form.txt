set value in reactive form
===========================
	they are two-three ways

1:set the value of entire form in one go
========================================


exm:
	this.addLoanTypeForm = this.fb.group({
      loanName: new FormControl('Tanveer'),
      loanType: new FormControl('personal loan'),
      loanDescription: new FormControl('loan application'),
    })

2:setting the form value using "setvalue" : craete a obj and pass in the method
=========================================
		exm:

    //craete a object for setvalue
    const loanObj = {
      loanName : 'Tanveer loan',
      loanType : 'personal loan',
      loanDescription : 'This is loan application'
    }
    //using setValule
    this.addLoanTypeForm.setValue(loanObj);
  }

note: u have to provide all the value in the object otherwise we will get the error
